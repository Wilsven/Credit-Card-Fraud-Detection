# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Credit card fraud losses total billions of dollars each year and is a major problem for financial institutions, customers and merchants. The 2018 Nilson Report estimated over $9 billion in fraudulent credit card transactions in the United State alone. Banks process thousands of transactions every minute and possess huge data sets, making good fraud detection models both necessary and possible.

I will explore the data to look for trends to detect fraud. Once relevant features are chosen, I will compare several machine learning algorithms and evaluate their performances. The biggest problem for fraud detec- tion models are imbalanced datasets. Credit card datasets are very large with few fraudulent transactions. Therefore, instead of overall accuracy, the focus of this project will be the process of choosing predictors, comparing and tuning algorithms for predicting the minority class and cost-saving results.
